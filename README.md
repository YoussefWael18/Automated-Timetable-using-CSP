# University Timetable Scheduler [Work in Progress]

![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-in%20progress-yellow)

This project is an automated university timetabling system designed to solve complex scheduling problems. It explores multiple approaches, including formal **Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP)** techniques and various **direct scheduling heuristics**.

## ðŸš§ Current Status

**This project is under active development and heavy refactoring.**

The core logic is currently being revised to improve efficiency, test different scheduling algorithms, and ensure all constraints are handled correctly. Please be aware that the code is in a highly active state of development. Branches may be unstable, and features described may not be fully implemented or may change without notice.

## Project Goal

The primary goal is to create a robust and efficient scheduler capable of generating a valid, clash-free timetable for all university courses, rooms, instructors, and student groups while respecting a variety of hard and soft constraints.

## What to Expect

- **Incomplete Features:** Not all functions may work as intended.
- **Frequent Changes:** The codebase, data structures, and algorithms are subject to change.
- **Limited Documentation:** In-depth documentation will be written once the core architecture is finalized.

Thank you for your interest! Please check back later for a more stable version.
